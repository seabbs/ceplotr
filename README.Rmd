**This package was outlined ahead of the HE Hackathon 2019 @Imperial. After a group discussion it was not continued in favour of aiming to improve documentation + testing for [BCEA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BCEA/index.html)** 

This package aims to: 

* Provide standarised modular plotting functions for cost effectiveness analysis.
* Support a single data format which is model and application agnostic.
* Provide data transformation tooling to support cost effectiveness analysis.
* Support converting model simulations, costs, etc. into this standard format. 
* Provide detailed documentation of all functionality. 
* Support interactive use via an interface.
* Be modular, user modfiable and extendable. 
* Be fully tested, reliable and easy to use.

## Docker

This package has been developed in docker based on the `rocker/tidyverse` image, to access the  development environment enter the following at the command line (with an active docker daemon running),

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker pull seabbs/ceplotr
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e USER=ceplotr -e PASSWORD=ceplotr --name getTBinR seabbs/ceplotr
```

The rstudio client can be accessed on port `8787` at `localhost` (or your machines ip). The default username is ceplotr and the default password is ceplotr. Alternatively, access the development environment via [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/seabbs/ceplotr/master?urlpath=rstudio).
